But the literature has already established that misspecification issues also cause parameter instability after policy changes in DSGE models. This paper will look at the implications of parameter shifts for econometric policy evaluation, to see whether policy advice derived from DSGE models would have differed fundamentally from that which the policymakers of the 1970s derived from their reduced-form Phillips curves. The results show drift in most parameters, including those that are supposedly structural (such as the share of capital in production, habits or the elasticity of labour supply to the real wage), and major shifts in the impulse response functions derived from the real-time estimation of the model. After the expansionary monetary shocks of the early 1970s, a~standard DSGE model would have behaved very similarly to an old-style Phillips curve, with marked shifts in parameter values and impulse response functions.},

While each of these factors may have played some role, the crisis can be much more accurately described as one of ignorance than malevolence. The common thread tying the emergence of the bubble to the disastrous consequences of its bursting is the misunderstanding of correlation and causation links in three key domains: economic policy, financial modeling, and the regulatory framework. These misunderstandings helped fuel the housing bubble and introduced fragility into the system, making it vulnerable to the bubble’s subsequent, unavoidable burst.},

	abstract = {Policy makers and economists alike failed to predict the financial crisis of 2008. Their failure is due not only to the difficulties in predicting events in a~complex world, but to the self-referential character of modern macroeconomics. Instead of seeking new empirical insights about economic behavior, macroeconomists have become creators of computer games—content to develop models that are internally consistent but have no necessary connection to the real world. Economic modeling aspires to be scientific in its deductive consistency and rigor. However, even the natural sciences require a~good dose of induction, which, in turn, entails varying one's method of study based on the phenomenon one is studying.},

We propose a~new framework, based on explicit micro foundations, within which macro policy can be studied. The framework is analytically tractable and easily quantifiable. We calibrate the model to standard observations and use it to measure the cost of inflation. We find that going from 10 percent to 0 percent inflation is worth between 3 and 5 percent of consumption—much higher than previous estimates.},

However, this turning away has gone in mutually inconsistent directions and is in the long run unsustainable. It should be more widely recognized that careful applied work in macroeconomics, using steadily advancing probabilistic modeling techniques, has been steadily increasing.},

Because of the usefulness of this class of models for addressing questions regarding the impact and consequences of alternative monetary policies they are nowadays widely used for forecasting and policy analysis at central banks and other institutions. In this paper we provide a~brief description of the two main aggregate euro area models at the ECB. Both models share a~common core but their detailed specification differs reflecting their specific focus and use. The New Area Wide Model (NAWM) has a~more elaborate international block, which is useful for conditioning the euro area projections on assumptions about foreign economic activity, prices and interest rates and to widen the scope for scenario analysis. The Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (CMR) model instead has a~more developed financial sector, which allows it to be used for monetary and financial scenarios and for cross checking. Based on the comparison of two models we find a~broad agreement on the qualitative predictions they make, although, in quantitative terms, there are some differences. However, the perspectives provided by the two models are often complementary, rather than conflicting.},

Second, I~argue that the approach advocated is capable of providing new insights about some of the main issues in monetary economics: the effects of monetary shocks, the welfare cost of inflation, and the roles of inside and outside money.},

In this paper, we begin by analyzing household scanner data to confirm the salient empirical results. We then proceed to formulate a~new dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modelling framework that captures both the intensive and extensive margins of demand, and we investigate the implications of this framework under two alternative sources of firm-level heterogeneity. First, in the case of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, we obtain analytic results for consumer demand and firms’ price-setting behavior and we show that the implications of the model are consistent with the key stylized facts. Second, in the case of staggered nominal price contracts, we show that the presence of customer search has important consequences for the welfare costs of inflation variability and hence for the design of monetary policy.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the econometrics of computed dynamic models. Since these models generally lack a~closed-form solution, their policy functions are approximated by numerical methods. Hence, the researcher can only evaluate an approximated likelihood associated with the approximated policy function rather than the exact likelihood implied by the exact policy function. What are the consequences for inference of the use of approximated likelihoods? First, we find conditions under which, as the approximated policy function converges to the exact policy, the approximated likelihood also converges to the exact likelihood. Second, we show that second order approximation errors in the policy function, which almost always are ignored by researchers, have first order effects on the likelihood function. Third, we discuss convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates. Finally, we propose to use a~likelihood ratio test as a~diagnostic device for problems derived from the use of approximated likelihoods.},
